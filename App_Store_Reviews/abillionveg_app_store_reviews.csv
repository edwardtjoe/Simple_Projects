I was SO surprised and instantly started loving this app even more. Check out their website: 1 review = $1 donated. Write 10 reviews and donate $10. This is not money out of your own pocket, it‚Äôs directly from abillionveg. I will continue writing reviews so I can unlock more donations. LOVE their mission of bringing the veggie community together while also supporting rescue sanctuaries and orgs. I‚Äôd give them 100 stars if possible.

Update: I wish there was some type of ‚Äúsearch‚Äù bar on your own profile so you can easily find one of your past reviews to update it. Your profile list can get pretty long once you review dozens of products/dishes. Also, they will make you remove your review of a product that is not 100% plant based (I don‚Äôt agree with this... if something is meat-free but not vegan I would like to see reviews so I can know to NOT buy that product.

Wrong!) and the app was telling me my best closest option for dinner was an Italian restaurant in Georgia. It said I have nothing close to me...yet I know of at least ten big chain restaurants within 3 miles that have decent options. This app only works by someone reviewing ONE meal at ONE single location. It doesn‚Äôt upload restaurant menus or anything like that.
